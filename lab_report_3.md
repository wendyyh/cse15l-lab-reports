# CSE 15L Lab Report 3: Researching Commands
The text processing commands, such as `less`, `find`, and `grep`, aim to manipulate and analyze text files. These commands can preview text contents, search for specific files/directories, sort out specific patterns or strings of text, and perform many other complex operations.

In this lab report, we will focus on the functionality and various command-line options of the `grep` command.

## Functionality of the `grep` command
The `grep` command is a powerful tool for searching for patterns in text files. It search a file or files for the given string and print matching lines. Its format is `grep <string> <file name>`.

## Command-line option: `-v`
The command-line option `-v` inverts the sense of the search, which means it shows only the lines that do not match the given pattern.

## Command-line option: `-c`
The command-line option `-c` counts the number of matching lines.

## Command-line option: `-w`
The command-line option `-w` matches only whole words, which means it treats the given pattern as a whole word and searches for lines that contain the exact given word.
